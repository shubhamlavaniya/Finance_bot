Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates .

The Company 's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September . An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company 's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters , which will occur in the first quarter of the Company 's fiscal year ending September 30 , 2023 .

Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone , Mac , iPad , Services and other products . The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers . Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers . For most of the Company 's Products net sales , control transfers when products are shipped . For the Company 's Services net sales , control transfers over time as services are delivered . Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services , as applicable .

Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services , as applicable . The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns , price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company 's expectations and historical experience . For arrangements with multiple performance obligations , which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct , the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices ( `` SSPs '' ) . When available , the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs . When observable prices are not available , SSPs are established that reflect the Company 's best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis . The Company 's process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including , where applicable , prices charged by the Company for similar offerings , market trends in the pricing for similar offerings , product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation . The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone , Mac , iPad and certain other products . The first performance obligation , which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price , is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale . The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services , which include iCloud , Siri and Maps . The third performance obligation is the right to receive , on a when-and-if-available basis , future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device . The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs . Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations , the allocation of revenue is based on the Company 's estimated SSPs .

Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer , which generally occurs when the product is shipped . Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided . Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software , including estimated warranty costs , are recognized at the time of sale . Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred . For certain long-term service arrangements , the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered . For these arrangements , the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services . The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services . Accordingly , the Company has not recognized revenue , and does not disclose amounts , related to these undelivered services . Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34 For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer , the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers . The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products , including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product , retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product . For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company 's other digital content stores , the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer . Therefore , the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains .

Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company 's business are generally available from multiple sources , certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources . The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones , personal computers , tablets , wearables and accessories . Therefore , many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources , are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations . The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors , and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source . When a component or product uses new technologies , initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers ' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased . The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices , or at all , may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company 's requirements . Substantially all of the Company 's hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia , with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland .

A company 's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ( 1 ) pertain to the maintenance of records that , in reasonable detail , accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ; ( 2 ) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles , and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company ; and ( 3 ) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition , use , or disposition of the company 's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements . Because of its inherent limitations , internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements . Also , projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions , or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate . /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose , California October 27 , 2022 Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52 Item 9 .

If we consolidate or merge with or into any other person or sell , transfer , lease or convey all or substantially all of our properties and assets in accordance with the Indentures , the Successor will be substituted for us in the Indentures , with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the Indentures . As a result , the Successor may exercise our rights and powers under the Indentures , and we will be released from all our liabilities and obligations under the Indentures and under the debt securities . For purposes of this covenant , `` person '' means any individual , corporation , partnership , limited liability company , joint venture , association , joint-stock company , trust , unincorporated organization or government or any agency or political subdivision thereof or any other entity .

An event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series of debt securities issued under the Indentures .

Discharge , Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance We may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been delivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become due and payable within one year ( or scheduled for redemption within one year ) by depositing with the trustee , in trust , funds in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including , but not limited to , the principal and premium , if any , and interest to the date of such deposit ( if due and payable ) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the Notes of that series , as the case may be . We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term U.S. Treasury securities . The Indentures provide that we may elect either ( 1 ) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the Notes of a series ( except for , among other things , obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes , to replace temporary or mutilated , destroyed , lost or stolen Notes , to maintain an office or agency with respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust ) ( `` legal defeasance '' ) or ( 2 ) to be released from our obligations to comply with the restrictive covenants under the applicable Indenture , and any omission to comply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the Notes of a series and clauses ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) under the caption `` Events of Default '' above will no longer be applied ( `` covenant defeasance '' ) .

If we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series , the amount in U.S. dollars , or U.S. government obligations ( as such term is modified below ) , or both , on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient , in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants , to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such event of default . However , we would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of acceleration .

With respect to the 3.050 % 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes , the term `` U.S. government obligations '' shall instead mean ( x ) any security that is ( i ) a direct obligation of the United Kingdom government or ( ii ) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United Kingdom government the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the United Kingdom government or the central bank of the United Kingdom government , which , in either case ( x ) ( i ) or ( ii ) , is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof , and ( y ) certificates , depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause ( x ) ( i ) or ( x ) ( ii ) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof . We will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance will not cause the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes of that series to recognize income , gain or loss for federal income tax purposes . If we elect legal defeasance , that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect . We may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option . Book-Entry and Settlement The Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with , or on behalf of , a common depositary",2022,1,400

Book-Entry and Settlement The Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with , or on behalf of , a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream , and are registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee . Except as described herein , certificated notes will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes . Certificated Notes Subject to certain conditions , the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor , in minimum denominations of EUR100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of EUR1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 2022 Notes , the 2024 Notes , the 0.000 % 2025 Notes , the 0.875 % 2025 Notes , the 2026 Notes , the 2027 Notes , the 1.375 % 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes , and in minimum denominations of PS100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of PS1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 3.050 % 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes , if : 1. the common depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if the common depositary ceases to be eligible under the applicable Indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days ; 2. we determine that the Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver to the trustee an order to that effect ; or 3. an event of default with respect to the Notes will have occurred and be continuing . Any Note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct .

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries . The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates . Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period 's presentation . The Company 's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September . An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company 's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters , which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 . The Company 's fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks , whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each . Unless otherwise stated , references to particular years , quarters , months and periods refer to the Company 's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters , months and periods of those fiscal years . Revenue The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities . Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest . Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents . Marketable Securities The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method . Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in , first-out method . Property , Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property , plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis . Derivative Instruments The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets .

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers . For most of the Company 's Products net sales , control transfers when products are shipped . For the Company 's Services net sales , control transfers over time as services are delivered . Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services , as applicable . The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns , price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company 's expectations and historical experience . For arrangements with multiple performance obligations , which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct , the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices ( `` SSPs '' ) . When available , the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs . When observable prices are not available , SSPs are established that reflect the Company 's best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis . The Company 's process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including , where applicable , prices charged by the Company for similar offerings , market trends in the pricing for similar offerings , product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation . The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of",2023,1,400
cash_flow_2023,cash_flow_2023_6,"applicable , prices charged by the Company for similar offerings , market trends in the pricing for similar offerings , product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation . The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone , Mac , iPad and certain other products . The first performance obligation , which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price , is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale . The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services , which include iCloud , Siri and Maps . The third performance obligation is the right to receive , on a when-and-if-available basis , future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device . The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs . Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations , the allocation of revenue is based on the Company 's estimated SSPs . Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer , which generally occurs when the product is shipped . Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided . For certain long-term service arrangements , the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered . For these arrangements , the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services . The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services . Accordingly , the Company has not recognized revenue , and does not disclose amounts , related to these undelivered services . For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer , the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers . The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products , including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product , retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product . For third-party applications sold through",2023,1,400

The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products , including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product , retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product . For third-party applications sold through the App Store , the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer . Therefore , the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains .

The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument 's underlying contractual maturity date . Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk . However , the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures . There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates . The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged , which are generally classified as operating activities . Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates , the Company may use forwards , options or other instruments , and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges . The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases , typically for up to 12 months . To protect the Company 's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates , the Company may use forwards , cross-currency swaps or other instruments . The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges . As of September 30 , 2023 , the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 19 years . The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates , as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in",2023,1,400

( 2 ) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . The derivative assets above represent the Company 's gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform . To mitigate credit risk , the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds . To further limit credit risk , the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company 's derivative contracts , under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by",2023,1,400

To further limit credit risk , the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company 's derivative contracts , under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other . As of September 24 , 2022 , the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company 's derivative contracts , including the effects of collateral , would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion , resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million .

The Company 's third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41 % and 44 % of total trade receivables as of September 30 , 2023 and September 24 , 2022 , respectively . The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk . Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company . The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers . The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales . Rather , the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company . As of September 30 , 2023 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10 % or more of total vendor non-trade receivables , which accounted for 48 % and 23 % .

The recovery amount was calculated to be EUR13.1 billion , plus interest of EUR1.2 billion . The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union ( the `` General Court '' ) . On July 15 , 2020 , the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision . On September 25 , 2020 , the European Commission appealed the General Court 's decision to the European Court of Justice ( the `` ECJ '' ) and a hearing was held on May 23 , 2023 .

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company 's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles . A company 's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ( 1 ) pertain to the maintenance of records that , in reasonable detail , accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ; ( 2 ) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles , and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company ; and ( 3 ) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition , use , or disposition of the company 's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements . Because of its inherent limitations , internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements . Also , projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions , or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate . /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose , California November 2 , 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51 8/4/25 , 3:45 PM aapl-20230930 https : //www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000106/aapl-20230930.htm 64/74 Item 9 .

Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company 's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP . The Company 's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that : ( i ) pertain to the maintenance of records that , in reasonable detail , accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company 's assets ; ( ii ) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP , and that the Company 's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company 's management and directors ; and ( iii ) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition , use , or disposition of the Company 's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements . Management , including the Company 's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer , does not expect that the Company 's internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud . A control system , no matter how well designed and operated , can provide only reasonable , not absolute , assurance that the objectives of the control system are met . Further , the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints , and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs . Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems , no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues",2023,1,400

Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems , no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud , if any , have been detected . Also , any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions , or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate . Management 's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company 's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting ( as defined in Rule 13a-15 ( f ) under the Exchange Act ) .
